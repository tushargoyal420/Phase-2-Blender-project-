#TO MAKE A HUMAN:

~Using Ctrl+R cut it into to loop vertically and then select left sides 4 vertices and 4 vertices of center.
~Press X to delete them. then delete all faces.
~Go to Modifiers tool bar and add a Mirror modifier.
~select lower four vertices and then move them along Z axis.
~Press ctrl+R to loop cuts.
~cut it into many parts.
~then adjust the all vertices. According to human body.
~Using Loop cuts cuts the body into parts.
~Then extrude lower face to make a leg.
~After completing human body then Right click on the body and select smooth option.
~Then adjust the location of that vertices which are not correctly places.
~Then Press Shift+A and make a new cube on the neck.
