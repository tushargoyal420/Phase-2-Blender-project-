~Using Extrude and Move tool make a front gates.
~Press Ctrl+R to loop cut and cut it into many parts. To make a building design.
~Press Shift+A to create a new plane to make a window.
~Using Extrude and Move tool make 11 Block windows. 
~Rotate the angle and then Press Shift+A to create a new cube.
~Place that cube adjacent to the previous cube.
~Using Extrude extrude it in Y axis.
~Select the windows and Then Press Shift+D to make a copy of that windows and then rotate it into Z axis (Z=90). 
~Place it into front of new cube to make a windows in that building.
~Press Shift+A to create a new cube and place it on lower side of the building to make a gate. 
~Then Add new cube in right side. then using extrude tool make a windows and gate and then select them and Copy paste into many times.
~At the back side make a new gate and windows.
~Press Shift+A and take a cylinder and UV Sphere and make a pipe with it.
~Place it into corner of the walls.
~Press Shift+A and take a cylinder. Then using S adjust size in small size.
~Place it front of the entrance gate to make a lights.
~Press Shift+A and take Cube and press I and then move mouse towards center, to make a focus light. Then place it in entrance gate shelter.
~Take a new cube and place it at bottom.
~Extrude the faces in front to make a stairs and then extrude them to make a road. and then select the front face and press S to resize then press Z (Along Z axis) then press 0 and hit enter. To make a slop in the road.
~Make a path at every Gate using (Same as Step 27).
~Press SHift+A and take a cube and place it in front of building to make a road and join all paths with the main road.
~Press Shift+A and add a plane and then place it on the wall and make a toilet windows on the wall.

~In right side their is a modifier tool bar click on that and then select add modifier option then click on the mirror option.
~It will create a mirror image of the building.


#TO MAKE A LOGO AND WRITE SCHOOL OF SCIENCE:

~Press TAB to switch object mode.
~Press Shift+A and click on Text option(In popup list).
~Press TAB and to enter edit mode.
~Write SCHOOL OF SCIENCE.
~Then select all the words and adjust its size(using S key) and selects its font.
~Then Press TAB.
~Press R key and then Z key then Press 90 then hit enter(To rotate).
~Press R key and then X key then Press 90 then hit enter(To rotate).
~Then place it onto the upper wall of the block (using G key).
~Then press shift+A and create a new cube.
~Then place it adjacent to TEXT(School of health science).
~Using extrude make logo of the university.

#TO MAKE A HUMAN:

~Using Ctrl+R cut it into to loop vertically and then select left sides 4 vertices and 4 vertices of center.
~Press X to delete them. then delete all faces.
~Go to Modifiers tool bar and add a Mirror modifier.
~select lower four vertices and then move them along Z axis.
~Press ctrl+R to loop cuts.
~cut it into many parts.
~then adjust the all vertices. According to human body.
~Using Loop cuts cuts the body into parts.
~Then extrude lower face to make a leg.
~After completing human body then Right click on the body and select smooth option.
~Then adjust the location of that vertices which are not correctly places.
~Then Press Shift+A and make a new cube on the neck.
~Adjust that cube.


#COLORING:
~In right side their is a material properties toobar click on that.
~Then their is a " + " symbol option click on that then click " New " option.
~Their is a option Viewport Display. In that option choose the color black and then select a face which i have to fill then click on the assign option.
~Then adjust roughness, surface color, surface type, etc.

~Repeat these steps to fill colors in the building, Text, logo, road, windows, Grass. and fill the colors.


#ADJUST CAMERA AND ITS PATH:
~Select the camera and " alt+ R " to clear resolution. 
~Then place it into center. (Press N and then Set X,Y,Z= 0).
~Press Shift+A and go to curve option then add a circle.
~then similarly place it into center.
~then using S resize it, then place it outside the building.
~then select camera and then go to the object constraints properties then add a folow path of camera. then select that circle as a path for camera.
~Then check the folow curve option then click on the animate path option.
~then select the circle and press Shift+D to make a copy of that circle and then press S to resize then place it inner side of older circle.
~Then press Shift+A and then go to empty option and select a sphere and place it at the center(X=Y=Z=0).
~Then go to object constraint properties then add a folow path of that sphere. then select that new circle.
~Select the camera and go to object constraints properties and add a track to and then select the empty sphere as a track of the camera. 
~Then check the folow curve option then click on the animate path option.
~Then go to camera setting change its mode to ortographic and adjust its focal length according to building.


#Adding lights:
~press Shift+A and then go to the light option and add a Spot light and place it the wall of building.
~Then adjust its power.
~Using Shift+D keys make copy of that light and place it on the walls.
~after putting all the lights then Press Shift+A then go to light option and add a point light then place it on the back side of the builing.
~Then adjust its power and its location.
~Using Shift+D keys make copy of that light and place it on the walls.
~then add a new screen and open shader editor(in editor tool option).
~then select the area of building that have to fill colors.
~then fill the color.


#RENDERING:
~Go to output properties:
~select the total frames.
~select output as a FFMPEG video format.
~select RGB colors.
~resolution = 1920*1080
~set location to save.
~Then go to the RENDER option in the menu bar then select the render animation.
~Now all frames are in processing to render.

~~~~AFTER COMPLETING THE PROCESS GO TO THAT FILE LOCATION AND THERE IS A VIDEO OF THE OUR PROJECT.~~~~~~~
